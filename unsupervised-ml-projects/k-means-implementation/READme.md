# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. It includes a manual implementation of the K-Means algorithm, visualizations, and evaluation techniques like the Elbow and Silhouette methods to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: `Mall_customers.csv`
- Features used:
  - `Annual_Income_(k$)`
  - `Spending_Score`
  - `Genre` (converted to numerical via one-hot encoding)

## 🧠 Clustering Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Null value check
   - One-hot encoding of categorical features (`Genre`)
2. **Manual K-Means Implementation**
   - Random centroid initialization
   - Euclidean distance calculation
   - Cluster assignment and centroid update loop
   - Convergence check
3. **Visualization**
   - Scatter plots of clustered data
   - Centroid overlay
4. **Scikit-Learn KMeans**
   - Efficient clustering using `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`
   - Label assignment and seaborn visualization

## 🔍 Choosing Optimal K

### Elbow Method
Plots distortion (average distance to centroid) vs. number of clusters to identify the "elbow" point.

### Silhouette Score
Measures how well each point fits within its cluster vs. others. Score ranges from -1 to 1.

## 📈 Evaluation Techniques

- `cdist` from `scipy.spatial.distance` for distortion
- `silhouette_score` from `sklearn.metrics` for cluster quality

## 🧪 Predicting New Data

Includes an example of predicting the cluster for a new customer using trained KMeans model.

```python
new_data_point = np.array([[12,3]])
new_data_cluster = kmeans.predict(new_data_point)


📦 Dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


🧠 Learnings
- Manual implementation deepens understanding of clustering mechanics
- Visualization helps interpret customer behavior
- Evaluation metrics guide model selection
